FORKING IN GIT

Forking means copying the repository. Using fork to a repository you will be able to freely experiment changes without disturbing the original problem. They are used when you want to change someone else project or to use other projects as a starting point for you. To enable fork go to your profile. Then on the left side under organizations choose your organization. Then under repository forking select allow forking of private repositories. Forked repository will always be monitored and compared unlike the cloned repositories.
