MASTER BRANCHING

A branch is essentially is a unique set of code changes with a unique name. Each repository can have one or more branches. The main branch â€” the one where all changes eventually get merged back into, and is called master.

In Git, "master" is a naming convention for a branch. After cloning (downloading) a project from a remote server, the resulting local repository has a single local branch: the so-called "master" branch. This means that "master" can be seen as a repository's "default" branch.
